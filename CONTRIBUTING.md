# Contributing to Okta Open Source Repos

## Style

### Git Commit Messages

We use a simplified form of [Atom's](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) commit convention.

  * Use the present tense ("Adds feature" not "Added feature")
  * Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
  * Add one feature per commit. If you have multiple features, have multiple commits.

#### Template

    <emoji> Short Description of Commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    More detailed description of commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    Resolves: <Jira # or Issue #>

#### Emoji Categories
Our categories include:
  * :seedling: `:seedling:` when creating a new feature
  * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
  * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
  * :package: `:package:` when pushing a new release
  * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies, or generating files
  * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

If you do not see an exact emoji match, use the best matching emoji.

#### Example
    :memo: Updates CONTRIBUTING.md

    Updates Contributing.md with new emoji categories
    Updates Contributing.md with new template

## Running E2E Tests locally

E2E Tests will be run against the Custom Login, Okta-Hosted Login & Resource servers

Before running the tests locally, install all the dependencies in the root of this project:
```bash
npm install
```
To test the samples you will need the following configured in your developer org:
* [A Web application](/okta-hosted-login#prerequisites)
* [A SPA application](https://github.com/okta/samples-js-angular/tree/master/okta-hosted-login#prerequisites)
* A test user account with a known username and password.  Note that the USERNAME should be of the form "username@email.com"

Once you have those resources setup, export their details as the following environment variables:

```bash
export ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default
export CLIENT_ID={yourWebAppClientId}
export CLIENT_SECRET={yourWebAppClientSecret}
export SPA_CLIENT_ID={yourSpaAppClientId}
export USERNAME={userName}
export PASSWORD={password}
```

For Windows, please set the following environment variables:
- `ISSUER`
- `CLIENT_ID`
- `CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SPA_CLIENT_ID`
- `USER_NAME`
- `PASSWORD`

As an alternative you can provide the environment variables in a file named `testenv` in the root folder.

For example:

```
ISSUER=https://dev-12345.oktapreview.com/oauth2/default
CLIENT_ID=webclient123
CLIENT_SECRET=websecret123
SPA_CLIENT_ID=spaclient123
USERNAME=myuser@example.com
PASSWORD=mypassword
```

> **NOTE:** Windows has `USERNAME` as a built-in system variable, hence set the `USER_NAME` environment variable for testing.

Then run the E2E tests:

```bash
npm test
```

> **NOTE:** If you want to execute individual tests such as `npm run test:okta-hosted-login`, you will need to update the environment by running the following node script:

```bash
node scripts/setup-env.js
```

> **NOTE:** If you want to test a different org or client app, you need to delete the configuration file `.samples.config.json`, and start from [first step](#running-e2e-tests-locally)
